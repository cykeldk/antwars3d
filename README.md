# Antwars - the 3D Project
## Introduction
### Purpose
As great fans of the Battleships AI project during our first semester, we have been looking forward to taking an entire course in AI during the fourth semester.
Unfortunately that course was not in high demand this year, but we wont let that stop us.
This is why we decided to make our own 3D strategy game, and the Artificial intelligence to support it.
So far the plan is to create an interface to which future students can write their own AI to run competitive simulations against other students AI.

This project is an attempt to create both a 3D Real Time Strategy game and a match framework for future students at Copenhagen Business Academy to practice coding AI in.

##Interaction

students code a strategy for their antPlayer to follow.
or a player plays a singleplayergame vs the built in AI.

##Description
3d version of antwars singleplayer or AI vs AI
a platform for studentmade AI to play RTS against eachother.


the world will be a 3d-terrain, digging will not be possible.


##Gameplay

The objective of the game is to eliminate the other team by slaying their queen.
each AI begins with a queen-ant which can produce 2 ants for free.
each ant after that has a cost.

she can spawn X different types of ants:

	gatherer
	warrior
	scout

queen-ant: very slow, high health, no damage.
		can produce new ants at a cost of X amount of energy.
		energy is supplied from gatherers.

gatherers: 
	medium speed and health - speed decreases depending on how much they are carrying.
	Their role is to feed the queen-ant so she can produce more ants.

warriors: slow and high health high damage

scouts: fast, high viewrange low health.


##Platform

PC - Windows

##Technology

Unity 3D and C#

##Settings / Story

You are an ant colony that needs to survive and capture the most ressources and kill all threats (other colonies, other insects)

##Aestethics 

Animated graphics in realistic view
Scary (insects are scary)
Sound will be dramatically


##Milestones

 - [ ] Grid / Map / gameboard
 - [ ] Ants
 - [ ] Movement
 - [ ] Controls (camera and interaction with ants)
 - [ ] Abilties (Harvest ressources, Attack enemies & produce ants)
 - [ ] AI Colony
 - [ ] Implement a graphical environment (Grass, ants(3d-object) Food, etc)
