    "## Introduction\n",
    "*As great fans of the Battleships AI project during our first semester, we have been looking forward to taking an entire course in AI during the fourth semester.\n",
    "Unfortunately that course was not in high demand this year, but we wont let that stop us.\n",
    "We decided to make our Unity3D project a 3D RealTime Strategy game, inspired by Battleships AI and a presentation of Ant Wars by Tobias Grundtvig.*\n",
    "### Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an attempt to create both a 3D Real Time Strategy game and a match framework for future students at Copenhagen Business Academy to practice coding AI in.\n",

    "### plan\n",
    "So far we have only seen a short demo of how Ant Wars work, but we got the idea to create an RTS game, where the users have the option of writing their own AI using C#, in order to play against it, or let it compete with another AI.\n",
